# Status Report for the Week of 09/28/23

## Team Report

 - Previous week progress
   - Last week we engaged in verbal communications to synchronize our ideas and establish project's foundations

 - Progress and Issues
   - Github repository created
   - Collaborators were added to the repository
   - SSH Keys were generated and added to the repository for each team member access
   - Team members discussed and agreed on the allocation of software development responsibilities among themselves

 - Plans and Goals
  - Finish local environment, IDE setup and configuration for github, copilot
  - Start developing basic application functionality
  - Code review
  - Discuss further steps in development and select software communication channels such API, network, files, queue or database


## Contrubitions of Individual Members

 - **Martins Fernanda Gregorini**

   - Progress and Issues
     - I researched the different website tools available to start creating the front end part of the section to see the pros and cons of each website
     - We discussed in the group what we'd possibly like to see on the website like the camera itself and logs on the website
     - I was suggested to possibly use website tools that are already readily available then going down the route of making something from scratch
   - Plans and Goals
     - Ask the professor what are the best website tools and which would fit the needs we have
     - Narrow down or select the tool to use for creating our website
     - try to start figuring out the basics of the selected tool to have a plan of action on how to tackle the front-end portion of our project.

 - **Nicanor Sanderson**

   - Progress and Issues
     - We discussed with Professor about capabilities we envision for our project including:
       training TensorFlow using a large image dataset(Open Images), event logging to archive data on the detection
       of queried objects, and a few stretch goals such as depth perception.
     - Professor suggested we scale back our requirements and focus on a bare-bones application that is able to
       reliably detect a few objects such as face, hands, etc, and add features to that foundation.
     - He also gave a few critiques on our initial requirement draft to which I updated with non-functional requirements.
   - Plans and Goals
     - We are currently deliberating on how we will section off tasks. 
     - I am personally interested in developing the back end capabilities. More specifically, I would like to work on storing detected events(images)
       into some sort of data storage system, a SQL database or possibly text file, as well as assist in the training and development of the ML model.
     - Hope to have a complete concept of tech-stack for implementation.
     
 - **Richard Paul McDowell**

   - Progress and Issues
     - one 
     - two
     - three
   - Plans and Goals
     - planning one
     - planning two
     - planning 

 - **Nikolay Sizov**

   - Progress and Issues
     - I worked on researching different types of datasets and how they can be applied to our project
     - Discussed with our team software architecture. Its major parts, data flow and communication across different parts
     - Setup GitHub and Colab for collaborative work, ensured team members were able to access our repository
   - Plans and Goals
     - During this week I am planning to select a data set source and train the first model
     - I will discuss further details about application architecture with the team to ensure we are on the same page and preliminarily agreements are still valid for everyone's technology stack
     - I am planning to go into detail with our team about model training and backend service communication channel
