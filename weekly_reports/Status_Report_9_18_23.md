 - **Nicanor Sanderson**

   - Progress and Issues
     - We discussed with Professor about capabilities we envision for our project including:
       training TensorFlow using a large image dataset(Open Images), event logging to archive data on the detection
       of queried objects, and a few stretch goals such as depth perception.
     - Professor suggested we scale back our requirements and focus on a bare-bones application that is able to
       reliably detect a few objects such as face, hands, etc, and add features to that foundation.
     - He also gave a few critiques on our initial requirement draft to which I updated with non-functional requirements.
   - Plans and Goals
     - Should have roles solidified. 
     - Rough timeline for project completion.
     - Complete concept of tech-stack for implementation.
