Previous Week:During our class last week Wednesday we discussed with Professor the capabilities we envision for our project including: training TensorFlow using a large image dataset (Open Images), event logging to archive data on the detection of queried objects, and and a few stretch case functions such as depth perception. He suggested that we scale back our requirements and focus on a barebones application that is able to reliably detect a few objects such as a face, hands, etc, and add features to that foundation. He also gave a few critiques on our initial requirements draft to which I added our github repo link as well as non-functional requirements.

This Week: This week we went over a general schema for the project and are currently deliberating on how we will section off tasks. I am personally interested in developing the back end capabilities. More specifically, I would like to work on storing detected events(images) into some sort of data storage system, a SQL database or possibly text file, as well as assisting in the training and development of the ML model.

Next Week: By next week we hope to have our roles solidified as well as a rough project timeline.
