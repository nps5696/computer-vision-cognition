## Contrubitions of Individual Members

 - **Martins Fernanda Gregorini**

   - Progress and Issues
     - I researched the different website tools available to start creating the front end part of the section to see the pros and cons of each website
     - We discussed in the group what we'd possibly like to see on the website like the camera itself and logs on the website
     - I was suggested to possibly use website tools that are already readily available then going down the route of making something from scratch
   - Plans and Goals
     - Ask the professor what are the best website tools and which would fit the needs we have
     - Narrow down or select the tool to use for creating our website
     - try to start figuring out the basics of the selected tool to have a plan of action on how to tackle the front-end portion of our project.
