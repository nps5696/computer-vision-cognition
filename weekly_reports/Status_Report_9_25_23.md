# Status Report for the Week of 09/12523

## Team Report

 - Previous week progress
   - We stated configuring local toolset and development environemnt. Application architecture discussed, languages and libraries userful for our project choosen by team members. 
   - API was selected by our team to employ cross application communication between frontend and backend services

 - Progress and Issues
   - Github Prject and Scum Board created 
   - Team members started making tasks in the project board

 - Plans and Goals
   - Developing basic application functionality
   - Add more issues to HitHub Project 
   - Code review
   - Discuss further steps in development and select software communication channels such API, network, files, queue or database


## Contrubitions of Individual Members

 - **Martins Fernanda Gregorini**

   - Progress and Issues
     - I researched the different website tools available to start creating the front end part of the section to see the pros and cons of each website
     - We discussed in the group what we'd possibly like to see on the website like the camera itself and logs on the website
     - I was suggested to possibly use website tools that are already readily available then going down the route of making something from scratch
   - Plans and Goals
     - Ask the professor what are the best website tools and which would fit the needs we have
     - Narrow down or select the tool to use for creating our website
     - try to start figuring out the basics of the selected tool to have a plan of action on how to tackle the front-end portion of our project.

 - **Nicanor Sanderson**

   - Progress and Issues
     - We discussed with Professor about capabilities we envision for our project including:
       training TensorFlow using a large image dataset(Open Images), event logging to archive data on the detection
       of queried objects, and a few stretch goals such as depth perception.
     - Professor suggested we scale back our requirements and focus on a bare-bones application that is able to
       reliably detect a few objects such as face, hands, etc, and add features to that foundation.
     - He also gave a few critiques on our initial requirement draft to which I updated with non-functional requirements.
   - Plans and Goals
     - We are currently deliberating on how we will section off tasks. 
     - I am personally interested in developing the back end capabilities. More specifically, I would like to work on storing detected events(images)
       into some sort of data storage system, a SQL database or possibly text file, as well as assist in the training and development of the ML model.
     - Hope to have a complete concept of tech-stack for implementation.

 - **Nikolay Sizov**

   - Progress and Issues
     - As discussed with team we will start with basics in computer recognition. We will use face detection as MVP for this project 
     - Further discussed with our team software architecture.
     - Configued project in GitHub and team members started adding their issues/ticket to work on 
   - Plans and Goals
     - Continue working with Tensorflow and Keras libraries to build and optimie ML model
