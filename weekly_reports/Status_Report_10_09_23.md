# Status Report for the Week of 10/09/23

## Team Report

 - Previous week progress
   - Initial data set for the model training generated and labeled
   - Team members started making tasks in the project board

 - Progress and Issues
   - Backend code reviewed with the team
   - Few backend endpoints were developed for data submission (from MLed detectors)
   - Dataset was fully prepared and loaded to the ML notebook
   - CNN - convolutional neural network development started - tensorflow with keras libs are being used

 - Plans and Goals
   - Get all layers of CNN configured (input, convolutional, activation, ReLU)
   - Consider dataset augmentation if dataset is not large enough
   - Run ML (stretch goal)
   - Develop endpoint for FE data retreival calls to BE 
   - Code review
   - Discuss next steps across the team


## Contrubitions of Individual Members
