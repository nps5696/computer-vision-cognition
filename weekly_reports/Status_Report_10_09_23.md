# Status Report for the Week of 10/09/23

## Team Report

 - Previous week progress
   - Initial data set for the model training generated and labeled
   - Team members started making tasks in the project board

 - Progress and Issues
   - Backend code reviewed with the team
   - Few backend endpoints were developed for data submission (from MLed detectors)
   - Dataset was fully prepared and loaded to the ML notebook
   - CNN - convolutional neural network development started - tensorflow with keras libs are being used

 - Plans and Goals
   - Get all layers of CNN configured (input, convolutional, activation, ReLU)
   - Consider dataset augmentation if dataset is not large enough
   - Run ML (stretch goal)
   - Develop endpoint for FE data retreival calls to BE 
   - Code review
   - Discuss next steps across the team


## Contrubitions of Individual Members

 - **Martins Fernanda Gregorini**

   - Progress and Issues
     - Basics functionality developent for the front end portion of the project
   - Plans and Goals
     - Build frontend prototype
       
 - **Nicanor Sanderson**

   - Progress and Issues
     - Developed functionality to transfer face scan event, time of event, and event image to flask app via json payload
     - Flask app moves an event image to physical storage 
   - Plans and Goals
     - Will work on containerizing code with Docker
     - Integrate app with ML file
     - Develop connectivity components from Flask to front-end
     
 - **Richard Paul McDowell**

   - Progress and Issues
     - Tried to get access to the resource that Nate provided, but couldn't get into it
     - Tried to get some pictures taken for the training, but got an error
   - Plans and Goals
     - Ask Nate what I did wrong with getting into the resource provided
     - Get into the resource and start using it and getting practice with it
     - Talk about the error that I got when I tried to get the traning pictures
      

 - **Nikolay Sizov**

   - Progress and Issues
     - Dataset fully prepared and loaded
     - Deep learing CNN development started   
     - Hardware with dedicated GPUs was configured for Jupyter development environment
   - Plans and Goals
     - Build out CNN network with few internal layers and tune hyperparameters for accuracy
