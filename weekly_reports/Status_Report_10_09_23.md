# Status Report for the Week of 10/09/23

## Team Report

 - Previous week progress
   - Initial data set for the model training generated and labeled
   - Team members started making tasks in the project board

 - Progress and Issues
   - Backend code reviewed with the team
   - Few backend endpoints were developed for data submission (from MLed detectors)
   - Dataset was fully prepared and loaded to the ML notebook
   - CNN - convolutional neural network development started - tensorflow with keras libs are being used

 - Plans and Goals
   - Get all layers of CNN configured (input, convolutional, activation, ReLU)
   - Consider dataset augmentation if dataset is not large enough
   - Run ML (stretch goal)
   - Develop endpoint for FE data retreival calls to BE 
   - Code review
   - Discuss next steps across the team


## Contrubitions of Individual Members

 - **Martins Fernanda Gregorini**

   - Progress and Issues
     - Got the professor to tell me the website he used to start learning how to use react
     - Learnt how to use react and the basics and started messing around and getting used to it
   - Plans and Goals
     - Start getting the basics down for the front end portion of the project and have something to show
       
 - **Nicanor Sanderson**

   - Progress and Issues
     - Continuing to develop Flask API template 
     - Learning Flask functionality such as jsonify and GET/POST methods 
   - Plans and Goals
     - Should have a running code that can accept POST request and store time and event dictionary of facial recognition in coming week.
     - Will look to push stored event data to front end web server. 
     
 - **Richard Paul McDowell**

   - Progress and Issues
     - Researched some of the processes of facial recognition with smartphones
     - Got an assortmant of items to have the model train with
   - Plans and Goals
     - Start to go over the utility that Nate gave
     - Start working with Nikolay on more of the machine learning
      

 - **Nikolay Sizov**

   - Progress and Issues
     - Dataset fully prepared and loaded
     - Deep learing CNN development started   
     - Hardware with dedicated GPUs was configured for Jupiter development environment
