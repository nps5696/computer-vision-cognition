# Computer Vision Project

## Purpose

- The main idea behind this project is to leanr objectives about collaborative development of backend, frontend and machine learning modelling. Three main parts of application will be built to process data and produce meaningful events to the user.   

## Planned Outcome

- The system which i capable of detecting predefined objects from a camera feed
- Events are shown to a user within web UI
- FE communicate with BE to to pull new events using BE API interface 

## Technologies

- Backend will be written in python
- Machine learning will be performed in python, using tensorflow and keras libraries 
- Frontend will be build on React JS framework


## Flask API
- Serves as intermediary between TensorFlow model and front-end website
- Retrieves face scan event image and data via post request, json payload
- Latest event endpoint for front end retrieval

## Front-End
- Uses react via node.js and npm
- fetches event data list from flask api for web-server output
- button functionality to switch between event data that has been posted

## Deployment Guide


- To be added here ...
